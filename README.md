# .NET Core Interview Preparation Repository

Welcome to the **.NET Core Interview Preparation Repository**! This repository is designed to help you prepare for .NET Core-related interviews by providing clear and concise examples of key topics and concepts frequently discussed during interviews. Each section contains practical implementations, explanations, and best practices to help solidify your understanding.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
- **Abstraction**: Examples of abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: Illustrations of how to restrict access to members using access modifiers.
- **Inheritance**: Code demonstrating base and derived class relationships.
